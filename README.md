# File-System-Organizer
A command-line utility that organises cluttered files in a directory into organised subdirectories according to their extensions.
In this small project, I adopted NodeJS as runtime environment to run my script. I built an utility which categorically cut and paste the files from a given directory and subdirectories to an organised folder.

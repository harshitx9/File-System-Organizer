# File-System-Organizer
A command-line utility that organises cluttered files in a directory into organised subdirectories according to files-extensions.
In this small project, I adopted NodeJS as runtime environment to run my script. I built an utility based on file system module of NodeJS which categorically cut the files from a given directory and subdirectories and paste them to an organised folder.
